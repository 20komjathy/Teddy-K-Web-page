          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p class="lead">TELL AND SHOW your story and data visualizations here. Notice how this HTML "lead" class tag enlarges and draws attention to this paragraph, compared to other paragraphs without this tag.</p>

          <p><a href="https://hartfordhabitat.org">Hartford Area Habitat for Humanity</a> is a non profit Christain affiliated organization in Hartford which works towards providing housing for those in need. Habitat's mission is to put God's love into action by building homes for families who are not financially capable of doing so themselve. As it says on their website, “Habitat for Humanity was founded on the conviction that every man, woman and child should have a simple, durable place to live in dignity and safety, and that decent shelter in decent communities should be a matter of conscience and action for all.” From 1989 to present day, Habitat has built a total of 265 homes for families in need. We teamed up with Habitat to help them build data and map their houses so they can have a better understanding of who and where they are building these homes. Educational attainment and Home Ownership can be used to track what type of people are using Habitat and what locations have Habitat been building in Hartford and Tolland.</p>

   <p class="lead">Build 4 Question.</p>
          My build stage 4 question was, in what kinds of neighborhoods is Habitat building homes? This question matters because their buyers want to live in areas that are safe and reliable. The satisfaction of their homeowners is a point of emphasis for Habitat so understanding the neighborhoods they have built in and the demographic makeup of those areas is important for Habitat’s future success in creating more safe homes. I focused on educational attainment and homeownership demographic census data to track where Habitat has been building its homes. The United States Census Bureau defines educational attainment as “the highest level of education that an individual has completed. This is distinct from the level of schooling that an individual is attending.” I chose Educational attainment as one of the demographics because in our society graduating from high school and college is crucial for finding a job and generating a stable income. Buying a home costs a lot of money and jobs that pay that amount often require a high school diploma and or a college degree. Tracking where Habitat has built homes in the past using this demographic allows for the organization to plan builds in the future, and gives them important information on the educational state of their neighborhoods. The second demographic I focused on was home ownership. “Home ownership or Owner occupancy is a form of housing tenure in which a person, called the owner-occupier, owner-occupant, or home owner, owns the home in which they live” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy">Source</a>. This demographic is important for Habitat because their mission is to provide people with affordable housing in hopes that they are able to save money in the future because they are not spending every dollar on their home. In 2020 Hartford Habitat for Humanity published the Reflective Report on the Impact of Homeownership. In this report it is found that 63% of people who have used Habitat say it was a good investment for them. A quote found on their report states “Benefits of homeownership that were not available to me as a renter from simple things like being able to start a garden and having creative control over home decor to more substantial things like providing security for my children, and also a sense of awareness, gratitude, and accomplishment that are embodied through the program” Habitat Report. By understanding the percentage of home ownership and owner occupied housing, Habitat can use this to continue their search for neighborhoods that need more owner occupied housing. This will benefit the individual but also the neighborhood as whole because the increase in saved wealth will allow for new areas of spending, such as being able to put more of their income into their child's education or even their own.</p>
